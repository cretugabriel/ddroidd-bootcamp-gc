# FAQ

### 1. Can I use project starters like react-create-app and others?
Yes, you are allowed to use any tech stack that suits you, along with boilerplates and starters.
The template was generated using `npm create vite` and you can use the same to generate the boilerplate for other stacks.

### 2. Should my project look exactly like the prototype? 
Your implementation should follow as closely as you can the provided prototype. 
However, even if you don't manage to implement the whole prototype, please commit your partial solution for review.

No, you can use `yarn` or `CDN` as well.
