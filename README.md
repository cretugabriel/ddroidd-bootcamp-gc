# ddroidd_ Frontend Autumn-Winter Bootcamp 2023 Web Challenge

Thank you, Ddroidd, for this amazing opportunity to test a bit my Front-End skills.
Unfortunately, I was not able to start the challenge two days ago due to personal matters.

Regardless, I have started it today and I believe I managed to complete around 85% out of it.

Tiny CSS changes and some JS validation remanined to be done, to be fully 100%.
Anyways, I would very much like to make sure at least I have submitted everything that I've worked for the past hours in the time given.
